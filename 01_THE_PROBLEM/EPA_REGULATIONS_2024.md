# EPA PFAS Final Rule: Complete Technical Summary
## National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (April 2024)

---

## Overview

On **April 10, 2024**, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized the first-ever enforceable national drinking water standards for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This rule establishes Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) and Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs) for six PFAS compounds.

**Federal Register Citation:** 89 FR 32532  
**Effective Date:** June 25, 2024  
**Compliance Deadline:** 2029

## Regulated Compounds and Limits

### Individual MCLs

| Compound | MCLG | MCL | Notes |
|:---------|:-----|:----|:------|
| **Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)** | 0 | **4 ppt** | Known carcinogen (IARC Group 1) |
| **Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)** | 0 | **4 ppt** | Possible carcinogen (IARC Group 2B) |
| **Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)** | 0 | 10 ppt | Emerging contaminant |
| **Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)** | 0 | 10 ppt | Long-chain PFAS |
| **HFPO-DA (GenX Chemicals)** | 0 | 10 ppt | PFOA replacement |

### Mixture Standard (Hazard Index)

For combinations of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS:

**Hazard Index = Σ (Concentration_i / HBWC_i) ≤ 1.0**

Where HBWC = Health-Based Water Concentration:

| Compound | HBWC (ng/L) |
|:---------|:------------|
| HFPO-DA | 10 |
| PFBS | 2,000 |
| PFHxS | 9 |
| PFNA | 10 |

**Example Calculation:**

If a water sample contains:
- HFPO-DA: 5 ng/L
- PFBS: 500 ng/L
- PFHxS: 4 ng/L

Hazard Index = (5/10) + (500/2000) + (4/9) = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.44 = **1.19**

This sample **exceeds the MCL** (HI > 1.0).

## Compliance Timeline

| Phase | Deadline | Requirement |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| **Primacy Revisions** | April 2027 | States adopt or defer to EPA |
| **Initial Monitoring** | 2027 | Begin quarterly sampling |
| **Compliance Determination** | 2027-2028 | Analyze results vs MCLs |
| **Treatment Installation** | 2028-2029 | If exceeding MCL, install treatment |
| **Full Compliance** | **2029** | MCLs enforceable |

---

## Monitoring Requirements

### Initial Monitoring (2027)

All community water systems (CWS) and non-transient non-community water systems (NTNCWS) must:

1. **Sample all entry points** to the distribution system
2. **Test for all 6 regulated PFAS** using approved methods (EPA 533, 537.1)
3. **Report results** to state primacy agency within 10 days

### Ongoing Monitoring

| Scenario | Monitoring Frequency |
|:---------|:--------------------|
| All results < MCL | Annually (may reduce to triennial) |
| Any result ≥ 50% MCL | Quarterly |
| Any result ≥ MCL | Quarterly until treatment installed |

---

## Analytical Methods

### Approved Methods

| Method | Developer | LOQ (ppt) | Compounds |
|:-------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| **EPA 533** | EPA | 1-5 | 25 PFAS |
| **EPA 537.1** | EPA | 1-4 | 18 PFAS |
| **ISO 21675** | ISO | 1-10 | 26 PFAS |

### Sample Collection Requirements

- **Bottle Type:** HDPE or polypropylene (no glass)
- **Preservative:** None (refrigerate at 4°C)
- **Holding Time:** 28 days to extraction, 40 days total
- **Sample Volume:** 250 mL minimum
- **Field Blanks:** Required for each sampling event

## Treatment Technology Options

EPA's best available technologies (BAT) for PFAS removal:

| Technology | Effectiveness | Capital Cost | O&M Cost | Notes |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:---------|:------|
| **Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)** | 60-90%* | Medium | High (replacement) | *Varies by chain length |
| **Anion Exchange (AIX)** | 70-95%* | High | Medium | Regeneration challenges |
| **High-Pressure Membranes (RO/NF)** | 85-99%* | Very High | Very High | Reject stream disposal |
| **Point-of-Use (POU)** | Variable | Low | Medium | Residential/small systems |

**Critical Note:** EPA acknowledges that no current technology consistently achieves 4 ppt for all regulated PFAS across all water quality conditions.

## Cost Impact Assessment

### National Cost Estimates (EPA)

| Category | Annual Cost |
|:---------|:------------|
| Monitoring | $172 million |
| Treatment | $772 million |
| **Total** | **$944 million/year** |

### Per-Household Impact

| System Size | Estimated Monthly Cost Increase |
|:------------|:-------------------------------|
| Very small (<500) | $35-70/month |
| Small (500-3,300) | $20-40/month |
| Medium (3,300-10,000) | $10-25/month |
| Large (>10,000) | $5-15/month |

## State Regulations (Often Stricter)

Several states have adopted limits more stringent than federal MCLs:

| State | PFOA | PFOS | Additional PFAS | Effective |
|:------|:-----|:-----|:----------------|:----------|
| **Vermont** | 20 ppt | 20 ppt | 3 others | 2020 |
| **New Hampshire** | 12 ppt | 15 ppt | 2 others | 2020 |
| **New Jersey** | 14 ppt | 13 ppt | PFNA: 13 ppt | 2020 |
| **Massachusetts** | 20 ppt sum | — | 6 PFAS combined | 2020 |
| **Michigan** | 8 ppt | 16 ppt | 5 others | 2020 |
| **New York** | 10 ppt | 10 ppt | — | 2020 |
| **Wisconsin** | 20 ppt | 20 ppt | — | 2022 |
| **Maine** | — | — | 20 ppt (any) | 2024 |

**Note:** Systems must comply with the more stringent of federal or state limits.

## Health Basis for Standards

### PFOA (4 ppt MCL)

| Endpoint | Effect | Reference |
|:---------|:-------|:----------|
| Cancer | Testicular, kidney | Barry et al. 2013 |
| Liver | Elevated enzymes | Multiple studies |
| Immune | Vaccine response reduction | Grandjean et al. 2012 |
| Developmental | Low birth weight | Multiple studies |

**MCLG Rationale:** 0 ppt because PFOA is classified as carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 1).

### PFOS (4 ppt MCL)

| Endpoint | Effect | Reference |
|:---------|:-------|:----------|
| Cancer | Possible (liver) | IARC Group 2B |
| Cardiovascular | Hypertension association | Multiple studies |
| Immune | Reduced antibody response | Grandjean et al. 2012 |
| Thyroid | Hormone disruption | Multiple studies |

**MCLG Rationale:** 0 ppt based on potential carcinogenicity and non-cancer effects at very low doses.

## Key Implications

### For Water Utilities

1. **Budget immediately** for monitoring costs (2027 start)
2. **Assess source water** for PFAS contamination risk
3. **Evaluate treatment options** — no single technology is universal
4. **Plan for disposal** — spent media is hazardous waste
5. **Prepare rate cases** — costs will be passed to ratepayers

### For Industrial Facilities

1. **Review discharge permits** — effluent limits tightening
2. **Evaluate source control** — eliminate PFAS upstream
3. **Assess liability** — contribution claims from utilities

### For Technology Providers

1. **Demonstrate 4 ppt achievement** — consistent, across water qualities
2. **Address short-chain PFAS** — biggest gap in current technology
3. **Develop regeneration solutions** — single-use is not sustainable
