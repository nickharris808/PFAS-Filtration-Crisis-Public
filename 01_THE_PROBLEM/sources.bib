% - GAC adsorption of PFAS (search: "granular activated carbon PFAS removal")
% - Ion exchange for PFAS (search: "anion exchange resin PFAS")
% - Membrane rejection of PFAS (search: "reverse osmosis PFAS rejection")
% - PFAS health effects (search: "PFAS epidemiology" or C8 Health Project)
% - Binding energy calculations (search: "PFAS adsorption thermodynamics")
%
% Do NOT cite specific papers without verifying they exist via:
% - Google Scholar (scholar.google.com)
% - PubMed (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
% - Web of Science
%
% Common journals for PFAS research:
