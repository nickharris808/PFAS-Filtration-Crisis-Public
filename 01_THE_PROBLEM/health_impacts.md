## Overview

The health effects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been extensively studied since the early 2000s. The most comprehensive data comes from:

1. **C8 Health Project** — 69,000 residents near DuPont Washington Works facility
2. **NHANES Biomonitoring** — Representative U.S. population exposure data
3. **Occupational Cohorts** — PFAS manufacturing workers
4. **European Studies** — Swedish, Danish, and German populations

This document summarizes the peer-reviewed scientific consensus as of 2026.

## Carcinogenicity

### IARC Classifications (2023)

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluated PFAS in November 2023:

| Compound | Classification | Interpretation |
|:---------|:---------------|:---------------|
| **PFOA** | **Group 1** | Carcinogenic to humans |
| **PFOS** | **Group 2B** | Possibly carcinogenic to humans |

**Group 1 evidence for PFOA includes:**
- Sufficient evidence in humans for kidney cancer
- Sufficient evidence in humans for testicular cancer
- Limited evidence for thyroid cancer

### Kidney Cancer

| Study | Population | Finding | OR/RR (95% CI) |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|:---------------|
| Barry et al. 2013 | C8 cohort (32,254) | Increased risk with cumulative PFOA | 1.10 (0.98-1.24) per doubling |
| Vieira et al. 2013 | Ohio/WV residents | Elevated incidence in high-exposure areas | 1.29 (1.00-1.66) |
| Shearer et al. 2021 | Finnish workers | Positive trend with serum PFOA | 1.73 (0.81-3.70) |

**Mechanism:** Proposed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway activation leading to oxidative stress and DNA damage.

### Testicular Cancer

| Study | Population | Finding | OR/RR (95% CI) |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|:---------------|
| Barry et al. 2013 | C8 cohort | Elevated in workers | 1.10 (0.99-1.22) per doubling |
| Steenland et al. 2015 | 3M workers | Positive association | 2.03 (0.71-5.79) |

**Mechanism:** Endocrine disruption affecting Leydig and Sertoli cells; Sertoli cell-only syndrome observed in animal studies.

## Immune System Effects

### Vaccine Response Reduction

The most replicated finding in PFAS epidemiology is reduced antibody response to childhood vaccines:

| Study | Vaccine | PFAS | Finding |
|:------|:--------|:-----|:--------|
| Grandjean et al. 2012 | Tetanus, diphtheria | PFOS, PFOA | 50% reduction per 2x serum level |
| Granum et al. 2013 | Rubella | PFOS | Inverse correlation (p<0.01) |
| Mogensen et al. 2015 | Tetanus | PFHxS, PFOS | Antibody levels below protective |
| Abraham et al. 2020 | Diphtheria | PFOA | Linear dose-response |

**ATSDR Conclusion:** "PFAS can decrease the antibody response to vaccines, potentially increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases."

### Infectious Disease Susceptibility

| Study | Population | Finding |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|
| Fei et al. 2010 | Danish children | Increased hospitalizations for infections |
| Impinen et al. 2018 | Norwegian children | Upper respiratory infections |
| Timmermann et al. 2020 | Faroese children | Common cold frequency |

---

## Liver Effects

### Elevated Liver Enzymes

PFAS exposure is consistently associated with increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT):

| Study | Population | Finding |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|
| Gleason et al. 2015 | NHANES adults | ALT increases 3-5% per doubling PFOA |
| Salihovic et al. 2018 | Swedish elderly | Dose-response for multiple enzymes |
| Jin et al. 2020 | Chinese adults | 7% ALT increase per unit PFOA |

### Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

| Study | Population | Finding | OR (95% CI) |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|:------------|
| Lin et al. 2010 | NHANES adults | PFOA associated with ALT elevation | 1.86 (1.24-2.78) |
| Bassler et al. 2019 | Review | Consistent evidence for hepatotoxicity | — |

**Mechanism:** PPAR-α activation leading to altered lipid metabolism; direct hepatocyte effects.

## Thyroid Disease

### Thyroid Function Alterations

| Study | Population | Finding |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|
| Melzer et al. 2010 | NHANES | Higher PFOA = higher TSH (women) |
| Lopez-Espinosa et al. 2012 | C8 children | PFOS inversely associated with T4 |
| Berg et al. 2015 | Pregnant women | PFOA associated with hypothyroidism |
| Webster et al. 2014 | Pregnant women | Higher TSH with higher PFOS |

### Thyroid Cancer

| Study | Finding |
|:------|:--------|
| Vieira et al. 2013 | Elevated thyroid cancer in high-exposure areas |
| Barry et al. 2013 | Non-significant elevation in C8 cohort |

**Note:** Evidence for thyroid cancer is "limited" per IARC (2023).

## Cardiovascular Effects

### Cholesterol and Lipids

One of the most consistent findings across all PFAS studies:

| Study | Population | Finding |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|
| Nelson et al. 2010 | NHANES | 4.6 mg/dL increase per ng/mL PFOA |
| Fitz-Simon et al. 2013 | C8 cohort | Dose-response for total cholesterol |
| Liu et al. 2018 | Meta-analysis | Pooled estimate: 5.0 mg/dL per doubling |

**Key Point:** The cholesterol effect is observed at population background levels (2-8 ng/mL serum), not just in high-exposure groups.

### Hypertension

| Study | Population | Finding | OR (95% CI) |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|:------------|
| Shankar et al. 2012 | NHANES | Elevated hypertension with PFOA | 1.54 (1.17-2.04) |
| Min et al. 2012 | NHANES | PFOS associated with hypertension | 1.22 (1.01-1.49) |

## Developmental Effects

### Birth Outcomes

| Outcome | Studies | Direction | Consistency |
|:--------|:--------|:----------|:------------|

| **Preterm birth** | 15+ | ↑ Increased | Mixed |
| **Preeclampsia** | 10+ | ↑ Increased | Low-Moderate |
| **Fetal growth restriction** | 10+ | ↑ Increased | Moderate |

**Meta-Analysis (Johnson et al. 2014):**
- PFOA: -18.9 g birth weight per ng/mL serum increase
- PFOS: -9.7 g birth weight per ng/mL serum increase

| Jorgensen et al. 2014 | Danish men | Lower sperm concentration with PFOS |

### Hormone Disruption

| Hormone | PFAS | Direction | Studies |
|:--------|:-----|:----------|:--------|
| Testosterone | PFOA | ↓ Lower | Multiple |
| Estradiol | PFOS | ↑ Higher (men) | Lewis et al. 2015 |

| Domazet et al. 2016 | Danish children | Higher BMI with prenatal PFOS |
| Halldorsson et al. 2012 | Danish birth cohort | Overweight at age 20 |

**Note:** The obesity association may be partially reverse causation (PFAS partition into fat).

## Dose-Response Relationships

### Critical Serum Levels

| Endpoint | PFOA (ng/mL) | PFOS (ng/mL) | Source |
|:---------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------|
| Vaccine response | 5-10 | 10-20 | Grandjean et al. |
| Cholesterol increase | 2-5 | 5-10 | Multiple |
| Liver enzymes | 10-20 | 20-40 | Multiple |
| Cancer risk elevation | 20-50 | 50-100 | C8 cohort |

### Current U.S. Population Levels (NHANES 2017-2018)

| PFAS | Geometric Mean (ng/mL) | 95th Percentile |
|:-----|:-----------------------|:----------------|
| PFOS | 4.25 | 15.0 |
| PFOA | 1.42 | 4.17 |
| PFHxS | 1.00 | 4.10 |
| PFNA | 0.37 | 1.30 |

**Critical Observation:** Population average PFOS levels are already in the range where immune effects have been observed.

## Vulnerable Populations

### Highest Concern

1. **Fetuses/Infants** — Transplacental and breast milk exposure
2. **Children** — Higher intake per body weight; immune development
3. **Pregnant Women** — Developmental outcomes
4. **Immunocompromised** — Reduced vaccine efficacy
5. **Occupationally Exposed** — Firefighters, chemical workers

### Environmental Justice

PFAS contamination disproportionately affects:
- Communities near military bases
- Low-income communities near industrial sites
- Communities with private wells (no regulation)
- Communities of color (proximity to contamination sources)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **PFOA is a confirmed human carcinogen** (IARC Group 1, 2023)

2. **Immune effects occur at background exposure levels** in the general population

3. **Cholesterol effects are dose-dependent** and observed across all studies

4. **Developmental effects** include reduced birth weight and potential cognitive impacts

5. **There is no known safe level** — effects observed at lowest measurable exposures
