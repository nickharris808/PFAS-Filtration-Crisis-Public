## Major Settlements

### 3M AFFF Settlement (2023)

| Aspect | Detail |
|:-------|:-------|
| **Amount** | **$10.3 Billion** |
| **Timeframe** | 13 years (2023-2036) |
| **Claimants** | Public water systems |
| **Claim basis** | Product liability, failure to warn |
| **Per-system average** | ~$3.5 million |

**Eligibility:** Any public water system that detects PFAS at or above 1 ppt can file a claim. The settlement covers testing, treatment, and monitoring costs.

**Important:** This settlement does **not** indemnify water systems against future claims from consumers. Utilities remain potentially liable for harm to ratepayers.

### Chemours/DuPont Settlement (2023)

| Aspect | Detail |
|:-------|:-------|
| **Amount** | **$1.19 Billion** |
| **Timeframe** | Lump sum |
| **Claimants** | Public water systems |
| **Geographic focus** | Areas near manufacturing facilities |

**Key Detail:** DuPont separated from Chemours in 2015, creating complex liability allocation issues. Both entities contributed to the settlement.

### Other Settlements

| Defendant | Amount | Year | Basis |
|:----------|:-------|:-----|:------|
| 3M (Minnesota) | $850 Million | 2018 | State natural resources damages |
| Wolverine World Wide | $55 Million | 2022 | Michigan contamination |
| Saint-Gobain | $21 Million | 2019 | New Hampshire contamination |
| Tyco Fire Products | Ongoing | — | AFFF products |
| Kidde-Fenwal | Ongoing | — | AFFF products |

## Federal Regulatory Enforcement

### EPA PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation

**Effective:** April 2024  
**Compliance Deadline:** 2029

| Compound | MCL | Penalty for Violation |
|:---------|:----|:---------------------|
| PFOA | 4 ppt | Up to $70,117/day |
| PFOS | 4 ppt | Up to $70,117/day |
| PFHxS | 10 ppt | Up to $70,117/day |
| PFNA | 10 ppt | Up to $70,117/day |
| HFPO-DA | 10 ppt | Up to $70,117/day |

### CERCLA/Superfund Designation

On April 19, 2024, EPA designated PFOA and PFOS as **hazardous substances** under CERCLA (Superfund).

**Implications:**

1. **Strict Liability:** No intent or negligence required
2. **Joint and Several Liability:** Any responsible party can be liable for full cleanup cost
3. **Retroactive:** Applies to past releases
4. **Reporting:** Releases above reportable quantities (1 lb) must be reported within 24 hours

**Who Can Be Liable Under CERCLA:**
- Current facility owners/operators
- Past owners/operators at time of disposal
- Generators of hazardous waste
- Transporters who selected disposal site
- Any party who "arranged for" disposal

### Clean Water Act Enforcement

NPDES permits now routinely include PFAS discharge limits:

| Sector | Typical Limit | Basis |
|:-------|:-------------|:------|
| Municipal POTW | 20-70 ppt | Technology-based |
| Industrial (direct) | 10-50 ppt | Water quality-based |
| Industrial (indirect) | Varies | Pretreatment standards |

| **Property damage** | Property owners near contamination | Trespass, nuisance |
| **Water system costs** | Utilities | Product liability, indemnification |
| **Natural resources** | States, Tribes | Trustee damages |
| **Consumer fraud** | Product purchasers | Failure to disclose |

## Utility Liability Analysis

### Sources of Liability for Water Systems

| Source | Risk Level | Basis |
|:-------|:-----------|:------|
| **EPA MCL violation** | HIGH | Direct regulatory enforcement |
| **Consumer claims** | HIGH | Failure to provide safe water |
| **Property value diminution** | MEDIUM | Served contaminated water |
| **Contribution claims** | MEDIUM | Other PRPs seek cost sharing |
| **Shareholder suits** | MEDIUM | For investor-owned utilities |

### Liability Estimation Framework

```
Total Utility Liability = Σ (Treatment Costs + Penalties + Third-Party Claims)

Treatment Costs:
- Capital: $10-50M (10 MGD plant)
- Annual O&M: $1-5M
- Present value (10 years): $50-100M

Penalties:
- MCL violation: $70,117/day/compound
- 1 year violation: $25M+ per compound

Third-Party Claims:
- Consumer class action: $50-100/person × population
- Example: 100,000 population = $5-10M
```

### Risk Factors Increasing Liability

| Factor | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|
| Detection above MCL | Direct regulatory liability |
| Detection above state limits | Stricter than federal |
| Proximity to known source | Potential contribution claims |
| Long detection history | Extended exposure period |
| Affluent service area | Higher damages potential |
| Inadequate treatment | Negligence allegations |

## Insurance Coverage Disputes

### General Liability Policies

Most commercial general liability (CGL) policies contain **pollution exclusions** that insurers argue apply to PFAS claims.

**Insurer Position:** PFAS are pollutants; pollution exclusion applies.

**Policyholder Position:** PFAS releases were not "polluting" at time of release; traditional pollution exclusion language does not apply.

**Court Decisions:** Split, with outcomes depending on:
- Specific policy language
- State law interpretation
- Characterization of PFAS (product vs. pollutant)

### Environmental Liability Policies

Some environmental liability policies (EIL, CPL) may provide coverage, depending on:

- Policy period
- Retroactive date
- Known condition exclusions
- Definition of "pollutant"

### D&O Liability

Directors and Officers may face personal liability for:

- Failure to disclose PFAS risks to shareholders
- Securities fraud (for public companies)
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Failure to implement adequate compliance programs

---

## Emerging Liability Theories

### 1. Public Nuisance

States and municipalities are pursuing public nuisance claims:

- **Theory:** Manufacturers created condition harmful to community health
- **Remedy:** Abatement costs, damages
- **Status:** Several state courts allowing claims to proceed

### 2. Market Share Liability

For cases where specific manufacturer cannot be identified:

- **Theory:** Allocate liability by market share of PFAS production
- **Precedent:** DES litigation (Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories)
- **Status:** Untested for PFAS, likely to be litigated

### 3. Design Defect

PFAS products alleged to be defective because:

- Persistence was known but not disclosed
- Safer alternatives existed
- Risks outweighed benefits

### 4. Failure to Warn

Manufacturers allegedly failed to warn:

- End users (firefighters, workers)
- Water systems
- General public
- Regulators

---

## Statute of Limitations Issues

### Discovery Rule

Many jurisdictions apply the "discovery rule" for PFAS claims:

- **Traditional:** Claim accrues when injury occurs
- **Discovery rule:** Claim accrues when plaintiff knew or should have known of injury and cause

**Implication:** PFAS claims may be timely even for exposures decades ago, if contamination was only recently discovered.

### Continuing Violation Doctrine

For ongoing contamination:

- Each day of continuing violation may restart limitations period
- Injunctive relief claims may not be time-barred

## Compliance Timeline and Recommendations

### For Water Utilities

| Deadline | Requirement | Recommendation |
|:---------|:------------|:---------------|
| **Now** | Understand exposure | Test all sources |
| **2025** | Evaluate treatment | Begin design if needed |
| **2027** | Begin monitoring | Submit to state |
| **2029** | Achieve MCLs | Install treatment |

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Document good faith efforts** to address PFAS
2. **Pursue contribution claims** against upstream sources
3. **Review insurance coverage** for potential claims
4. **Implement public notification** for detected PFAS
5. **Preserve records** of treatment decisions

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Liability is real and substantial:** $10+ billion already settled, $80+ billion estimated total

2. **Multiple liability theories:** Product liability, regulatory, tort, nuisance

3. **Utilities are not immune:** Even if manufacturers are primary defendants

4. **Compliance is critical:** 2029 MCL deadline approaching

5. **New technology needed:** Current treatment cannot reliably achieve 4 ppt
