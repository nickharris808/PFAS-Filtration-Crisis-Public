## Technology Summary

### PFAS Capture ("Fluorocatchers")

**Problem Solved:** Current adsorbents bind PFAS with energies of -40 to -50 kJ/mol, insufficient for reliable 4 ppt compliance.

**Our Solution:** Cationic host molecules with multiple binding interactions achieving -85 kJ/mol binding energy.

**Key Claims:**
- Composition comprising cationic centers and fluorous domains
- Binding energy threshold claims (>-80 kJ/mol)
- Regeneration methods (100+ cycles)
- Short-chain PFAS capture (C4-C6)

### Rare Earth Extraction ("Janus Ligands")

**Problem Solved:** Current extractants co-extract iron with rare earth elements, requiring multiple purification stages.

**Our Solution:** Bifunctional ligands with selective lanthanide coordination achieving 11,700:1 Nd/Fe selectivity.

**Key Claims:**
- Pyridine-dicarboxamide head groups
- Branched alkyl tail groups (LogP 3-6)
- Thermodynamic selectivity thresholds (>50 kJ/mol)

### Ion-Selective Membranes ("Quantum Sieves")

**Problem Solved:** Current membranes cannot discriminate between Li⁺ and Na⁺ for lithium extraction.

**Our Solution:** Engineered pore dimensions (0.7 nm) that impose dehydration-enthalpy barriers.

**Key Claims:**
- Critical pore dimension claims (0.65-0.75 nm)
- Dehydration barrier claims (>400 kJ/mol)
- Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity ratios (>1000:1)

### Computational Discovery

**Problem Solved:** Traditional molecular design is slow and requires extensive experimental iteration.

**Our Solution:** AI-accelerated platform combining DFT calculations with machine learning surrogates.

**Key Claims:**
- Combinatorial library generation methods
- Physics fuzzing for anomaly detection
- Two-head neural network architecture
- Commercial viability scoring
